# GasExpansion
Particle simulation of gas expansion

We are trying to simulate in microsopic view a process where the gas was initially uniformly filled the left half of a container, and as time goes on, the gas would expand to fill the entire container and never return to the original state.

Initially, let the particles randomly (uniform posibility) take the positions in the left half of the container, and give each particle a random velocity (distribution is not important). We assume that the interaction between two particles is elastic collision.
